An explanation on how to use some methods on mumax3

I'm not a bright student and I had some difficulties on undestanding how some methods works on mumax3. I found nothing else than the mumax3 API and some example to help me, therefore I asked for explanation to smarter people than me and I had some answers that could probably help someone else. Accordingly I though to write them down. If i did something wrong or misunderstood something (with high probability it happened) help me too!
